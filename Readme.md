# Data Processing Model to Perform Big Data Analytics in Hybrid Infrastructures

## Overview

This project introduces a hybrid data processing model designed to optimize big data analytics by combining cloud computing and volunteer computing environments. By leveraging the strengths of both systems, the model aims to improve resource utilization, enhance performance, and reduce costs associated with large-scale data processing.

The HR Alloc algorithm plays a crucial role in the model by dynamically managing data placement and resource distribution, ensuring optimal use of computational resources. The results of this approach demonstrate an increase in processing speed and a reduction in operational costs compared to traditional cloud-based solutions.

### Key Features:
- **Hybrid Data Processing**: Integration of cloud computing and volunteer computing for more efficient big data processing.
- **HR Alloc Algorithm**: A dynamic resource allocation algorithm that ensures optimal task distribution across available resources.
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduction in the reliance on costly cloud resources by offloading less critical tasks to volunteer computing.
